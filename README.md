## 🌟 Hi there! <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="30px">

My name is **Szymon Korus**, a 25-year-old programmer with a Master’s degree in Computer Science, specializing in **Interactive 3D Graphics** from the **Silesian University of Technology**. I initially completed my Bachelor’s degree in Automation and Robotics, but it’s **game development in Unity** that I’ve found to be my true passion and career path.

### 🚀 About Me

- 🛠️ I've been creating projects in **Unity** for 1.5 years, developing my skills through both team and personal projects.
- 🌱 This what excites me most about game development is the opportunity to provide entertainment and watch players take on the challenges I’ve designed for them.
- 🎯 I am currently looking for a position as a **Unity Game Developer**.
